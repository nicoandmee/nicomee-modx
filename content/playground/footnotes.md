During my illness, I learned about [MSD Manual](https://www.msdmanuals.cn/home) and [Tencent Medical](https://baike.qq.com/) on Twitter [^1], which helped me reorganize my understanding of some medical concepts. This unexpected gain made me realize that people should maintain communication and constantly update themselves in any situation.

Fun and addictive, Vampire Survivors is a work that can support the entire gaming experience with excellent mechanics alone. The graphics are almost just texture translation, but it doesn't affect its excellent gameplay (reminiscent of Dream Quest). Each game lasts 20 minutes, building around the weapon system, discovering the fun of different combinations, and challenging higher harvesting efficiency. It pioneered a new game mode and brought many imitators [^2]. But that's okay, bring more of such fun things.

In mid-July, I was asked to simulate a mobile app. I thought the fastest way was to write a webpage that meets PWA [^22] standards. After research, I added [Web app manifests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) to the webpage, and also added some [Safari-specific meta tags](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html) according to Apple's standards. The final effect was very good, achieving pixel-level restoration of the app experience. I'll write an article to summarize this later.

In the end, I found that [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) was the best choice. I always thought Vite was exclusive to the Vue ecosystem, but it turns out to be a general front-end development and build tool. Whether it's the out-of-the-box process or the clear documentation and API design, it brought me a very good user experience. [^23]
