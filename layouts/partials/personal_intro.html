<p>Hey, I'm <span class="my-name mark-line">Nico</span>, AKA <span class="my-name mark-line">nicoandmee</span> on the
  internet. I'm a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Backend Developer & Security Engineer</strong></p>
    <p>With 10+ years of experience spanning full-stack development and information security, I specialize in web
      scraping, JavaScript reverse engineering, and building resilient systems that operate at scale. My expertise has
      helped clients automate and extract data from complex platforms including <strong>Citibank</strong>,
      <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>BestBuy</strong>, <strong>Walmart</strong>, <strong>Ticketmaster</strong>, and
      <strong>AXS</strong>—often working around sophisticated anti-automation measures.
    </p>
    <p>I'm language-agnostic and love tackling challenging problems that push technical boundaries. Currently seeking
      opportunities to work under experienced leads who can accelerate my professional growth while I contribute
      meaningful solutions.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Flexible Professional</strong></p>
    <p>I work remotely and provide consulting services for businesses whose operations depend on reliable data
      extraction and automation. As I pursue my liberal arts degree at the University of Austin,
      <strong>I'm flexible with my schedule and can accommodate academic commitments while still delivering exceptional
        value
        to clients and employers.</strong>
      Please do reach out if you're interested in working together!

  <li>
    <p><strong>Open-Source Advocate</strong></p>
    <p>I'm a strong proponent of open-source software and contribute wherever possible. The collaborative FOSS model has
      proven to be one of the most enduring and reliable approaches to building technology. In an industry often chasing
      trends, I believe community-driven development, collaboration, and knowledge sharing are essential for creating
      lasting solutions.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Craftsman Approach</strong></p>
    <p>I view software engineering as a craft requiring dedication, precision, and continuous learning—similar to
      woodworking or welding. My primary objective is delivering tangible value through well-engineered solutions. I
      take extreme ownership of my code and maintain high standards in an era where rushed development is common. While
      AI tools have their place, I believe there's no substitute for deep technical understanding and methodical
      problem-solving.</p>
